# c-sharp_Utils
Some c# utils

## Usage
1. Download dll in bin/release
2. Add a reference to the dll in your project
3. Import it 
4. Start using it

## Methods 
1. ReverseString method
    * Reverses input string and returns it
    * It is a extension method and to use it write:
    * ```[name] = [name].ReverseString();```
2. Input
    * Adds a python like input
    * To use it type:
    * ```[data type] [name] = Input<[Data type]>([prompt txt]);```
3. Capitalize
    * This one is self explanatory
    * Capitalizes a string
    * This is also an extension method
    * To use it write:
    * ```[name] = [name].Capitalize();```
4. QuadraticEquationDiscriminant
    * This method calculates discriminant from quadratic equation
    * To use it write:
    * ```int [name] = QuadraticEquationDiscriminant([int a], [int b], [int c]);```
5. BinarySearch
    * This a binary search algorithm
    * To use it write:
    * ```int [name] = BinarySearch([array a], [name of number to be found in array]);```
6. EuclidAlgo
   * This is a euclid algorithm
7. MultiplyAllInList
    * This one is also self explanatory
    * It multiplies all numbers an a given array (PS: I know that the method name contains List so iÂ´m gonna fix it ASAP)
